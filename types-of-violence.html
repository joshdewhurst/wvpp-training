        <h1>Types of Workplace Violence</h1>
        <p>Workplace violence can manifest in various forms, and it is essential to understand the different types to recognize and prevent them effectively. This module outlines the four primary types of workplace violence.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Type 1: Criminal Intent</h2>
            <p>This type of workplace violence is committed by a person who has no legitimate business at the worksite. It includes violent acts by anyone who enters the workplace or approaches employees with the intent to commit a crime.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Type 2: Customer/Client</h2>
            <p>Workplace violence directed at employees by customers, clients, patients, students, community members, or visitors. This type of violence is common in service settings such as healthcare, social services, and retail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Type 3: Worker-on-Worker</h2>
            <p>Violence against an employee by a present or former employee, supervisor, or manager. This type can include physical assaults, threats, harassment, and bullying within the workplace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Type 4: Personal Relationship</h2>
            <p>Workplace violence committed in the workplace by a person who does not work there but has or is known to have had a personal relationship with an employee. This type includes domestic violence incidents that spill over into the workplace.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Understanding these types of workplace violence helps us to better recognize, prevent, and respond to potential threats, ensuring a safer work environment for everyone.</p>
