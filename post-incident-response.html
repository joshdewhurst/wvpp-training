        <h1>Procedures for Post-Incident Response and Investigation</h1>
        <p>Following any workplace incident, SFAF may enact some or all of the following post-incident procedures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conducting On-site Assessment: The designated WVPP administrator or their assigned representative will promptly visit the scene of the incident, ensuring safety and practicality.</li>
            <li>Interviewing Involved Parties: Relevant parties, including employees, witnesses, law enforcement, and/or security personnel, will be interviewed to gather comprehensive information about the incident.</li>
            <li>Reviewing Security Footage: If available, security footage from existing cameras will be reviewed to aid in understanding the sequence of events and identifying potential security risk factors.</li>
            <li>Assessing Workplace for Risk Factors: A thorough examination of the workplace will be conducted to identify any security risk factors associated with the incident, including previous reports concerning behavior by the perpetrator.</li>
            <li>Determining Incident Cause: Efforts will be made to determine the root cause of the incident, considering all relevant factors and circumstances.</li>
            <li>Implementing Corrective Actions: Based on the findings of the investigation, appropriate corrective actions will be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.</li>
            <li>Recording Findings and Actions: Detailed records of the investigation findings and the implemented corrective actions will be documented for future reference and accountability.</li>
            <li>Obtaining Law Enforcement Reports: Any reports completed by law enforcement regarding the incident will be obtained and reviewed as part of the investigation process.</li>
            <li>Utilizing Violent Incident Log: The violent incident log will be utilized for every workplace violence incident, capturing essential details such as the date, time, location, involved parties, incident description, and corrective measures taken.</li>
            <li>Reviewing Previous Incidents: A comprehensive review of all previous incidents will be conducted to identify any patterns or recurring issues that require attention.</li>
            <li>Providing Support and Resources: SFAF will offer support and resources to affected employees, which may include counseling services, referrals to employee assistance programs, and necessary time off work.</li>
            <li>Ensuring Confidentiality: Personal identifying information will not be recorded or documented in the written investigation report to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of individuals involved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not every incident may require all steps to be followed; actions taken will be proportional to the severity and specifics of the incident.</p>
