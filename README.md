# Workplace Violence Prevention Training

This repository contains the source code for a Workplace Violence Prevention Training program that I coded for my company, San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF), using HTML and CSS. This training is an example of how I was able to create an effective training module without the use of a traditional Learning Management System (LMS).

The training program includes several modules that cover key topics related to workplace violence prevention, such as definitions, types of violence, responsibilities, incident reporting, and emergency response procedures. For the purposes of this repository, I have included the core content to demonstrate my ability to code and structure a comprehensive training program.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The landing page of the training program with links to each module.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the training program.
- `introduction.html`: Introduction module.
- `why-wvpp.html`: Explanation of the importance of the WVPP.
- `definitions.html`: Key definitions related to workplace violence.
- `types-of-violence.html`: Various types of workplace violence.
- `responsibility.html`: Responsibilities of key personnel.
- `employee-involvement.html`: How employees are involved in the WVPP.
- `incident-reporting.html`: Procedures for reporting incidents.
- `emergency-response.html`: Emergency response procedures.
- `post-incident-response.html`: Post-incident response and investigation.
- `conclusion.html`: Conclusion of the training.
- `summary.html`: Summary of key points from the training.


## Disclaimer
This training program is a simplified version of the full training used at SFAF. It includes the core content to demonstrate my coding capabilities but does not include quizzes and some other interactive elements present in the full training.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further information!
