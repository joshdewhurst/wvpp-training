        <h1>Workplace Violence Incident Reporting Procedure</h1>
        <p>SFAF will implement the following effective procedures to ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All threats or acts of workplace violence are reported to an employeeâ€™s supervisor or manager, who will inform the WVPP administrator/Safety Officer. This will be accomplished by utilizing the Healthicity platform for anonymous reporting.</li>
            <li>If anonymous reporting is not feasible or preferred, employees can report incidents directly to their management or supervisor, or they can contact People & Culture through <a href="mailto:peopleandculture@sfaf.org">peopleandculture@sfaf.org</a>. People & Culture will ensure that the WVPP administrator/Safety Officer are looped in to handle the incident accordingly.</li>
            <li>A strict non-retaliation policy is in place, and any instances of retaliation are dealt with swiftly and decisively.</li>
        </ul>
